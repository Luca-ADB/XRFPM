# XRFPM
Fundamental parameter based simulation for the creation of XRF-CT scans based on experimental CT-scans.
This code was created as my master's dissertation topic under the XMI group of UGent.

# Data processing
XRFPM uses .tiff images of CT-scans to describe the mineral phases present in a sample, after which a fundamental parameter based method is used to calculate the fluorescence intensity under user given experimental conditions.
